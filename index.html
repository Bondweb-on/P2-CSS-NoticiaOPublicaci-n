        <p>¡Un saludo a todos los lectores de este blog! En esta ocasión quiero platicar con ustedes acerca de un final un tanto... curioso. Así es, estoy hablando del final de uno de los animes/mangas más famosos en los ultimos años "Shingeki no Kyojin" o como es más conocido en occidente "Attack on Titan". Cabe destacar que esta reseña contendrá spoilers del manga, así que si aún no lo terminas por favor no leas esto si no quieres comerte un spoiler.

        <h2>¿Final bueno o final malo?</h2>
        <p>Empezamos con un punto muy fuerte y por el cual se trata de algo muy discutido por los fans, ¿Es el final de Shingeki algo bueno o malo?</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
